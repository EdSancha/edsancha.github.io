This is my GitHub Page made with [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com). I've made it to play with front end development and to host my blog. You can download, fork and share the code. 

## Acknowledgements

I took the ideas for the apps grid from [Sam Soffes](http://soff.es) personal webpage. You can find his source code in his [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/soffes/soff.es)
