I"§<p>Iâ€™m on the move, again. Next week Iâ€™ll be starting a great job as iOS Developer in an amazing company, <a href="http://www.thrillist.com">Thrillist</a>, located in Soho, New York. Itâ€™s hard to explain how excited I am about starting over again but Iâ€™ll try.</p>

<p>First of all, why New York? San Francisco Bay is a thriving environment with thousands of opportunities, itâ€™s probably the area with more exciting projects that you can find. In fact, I love it.</p>

<p>Because I love it, thatâ€™s why I have to leave it. I want to experiment another great city, probably the one who is closely behind SF in technological terms, to figure out what I want to do in long term. Iâ€™ve heard so good things about New York, that when the possibility appeared in front of me I jumped over it.</p>

<p>Most of my friends support me blindly and Iâ€™m thankful for that. Thereâ€™re some that ask me about my fears, if Iâ€™m scared of a fresh start in the unknown and the fact is that Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m nervous, excited and I want to do it. My fears are more related to what happens if I like it. How long will I be in NYC? One year, three, all my life?</p>

<p>I have a place in my heart for the places Iâ€™ve lived in, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/Zk7NkyyiWy/">Las Palmas</a>, Paris, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/TxmXRySiel/">Madrid</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/oQYnr/">Phnom Penh</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/Y6fv4wyiUo/">San Francisco</a>. I know for sure that Iâ€™ll be back to all of them and who knows, I might be back for more than holidays. I have great ideas for some of those places: Iâ€™d love to live <em>â€œon the roadâ€,</em> living some months in different places but thatâ€™s another story. My next step will be enjoying the renowned <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/lmec/html/about/nycapital.shtml">Capital of the World</a> and tell the other places that:</p>

<p><em>*Itâ€™s a see you soon, not a goodbye.*</em></p>
