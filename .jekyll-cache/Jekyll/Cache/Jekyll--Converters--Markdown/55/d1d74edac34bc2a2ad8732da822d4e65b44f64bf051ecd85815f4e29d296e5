I"›<p>The last weeks Iâ€™ve felt like if I was in a state of stagnation. The worst thing is that sometimes I really feel like it. Itâ€™s strange to see the tricks the mind plays with yourself while you have free time so I thought writing about it was a great exercise to let that idea go (for a while).</p>

<p>The definition of stagnation is:</p>

<p><em><strong>Stagnation</strong>: To stay the same and not grow or develop</em></p>

<p>The first part of the definition is true. Iâ€™m waiting for some legal aspects to move to the next challenge and Iâ€™m excited about it, itâ€™s going to be awesome, but the reality is that Iâ€™ve been waiting for some weeks already, a lot in my opinion.</p>

<p>So, I have a lot of free time and youâ€™ll think, â€œAmazing, you can do what you want!â€, and itâ€™s true, somehow. I already have a great job waiting for me, so working or looking for a job isnâ€™t an option right now. I canâ€™t start a big personal project as I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll have to be again working full time. So, the normal things that everyone put in the positive balance are discarded.</p>

<p>These thoughts and the part of stagnation definition about growing and developing are the ones that are wrong. And I have a lot of points to prove it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Reading: Iâ€™ve retaken one of my favorite hobbies reading both fiction, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enders-Game-The-Ender-Quintet-ebook/dp/B003G4W49C/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392337054&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=enders+game">Enderâ€™s Game</a> for example, and technological, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mobile-Interfaces-Steven-Hoober-ebook/dp/B00630NWGK/ref=sr_1_6?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392336956&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=Designing+Interfaces">Designing Mobile Interfaces</a> is currently on my iPad. It feels so good after closing a finished book or reading the latest page in your electronical reader.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical development: Iâ€™ve been reading missing blog posts from great developers and experimenting with new paradigms (like <a href="https://leanpub.com/iosfrp">Reactive Functional Programming</a>) that I had forgotten when I was buried under a 10-12 hours job.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fitness development: More free time means that you donâ€™t have to fit your workouts into impossible schedules. Iâ€™m ridding my bike, started running again injury free and even had time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyboard">Bodyboard</a> surf in amazing <a href="http://instagram.com/p/kFRpBOyiV8/">spots</a>. My fatty abs hate me right now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Starting old ideas: Redoing a <a href="http://edsancha.com">personal page</a> and start <a href="http://edsancha.com/blog">writing</a> was hard and now I can make a habit of it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Summing this up, I can say that I havenâ€™t got stuck, Iâ€™ve grown, worked on self-development and I feel good, Iâ€™m just a bit eager to begin. I think that what my subconscious is trying to tell me is to keep doing all this things once I go back to the office. Iâ€™ve always thought that it should be the normal thing but I forgot it during the latest year.</p>

<p><strong>Job-stagnation is the real enemy</strong> so itâ€™s better to keep a note to myself:</p>

<p><em>â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter how amazing your current job is, you need to keep reading, improve technically, keep fit and continue working in personal projectsâ€.</em></p>
