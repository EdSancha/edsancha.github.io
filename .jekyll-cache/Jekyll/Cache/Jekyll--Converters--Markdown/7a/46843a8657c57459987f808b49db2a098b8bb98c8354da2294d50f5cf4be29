I"ù	<p>Itâ€™s already been two weeks in the big apple and itâ€™s starting to impress me in some good ways and in not-so-good ways. It wouldnâ€™t be fair to say that everything has been great. Iâ€™ll start with the â€˜badâ€™ things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The weather: itâ€™s the coldest winter I had lived in and thatâ€™s ok, but the weather changes are horrible. I have a cold since the day I arrived and I donâ€™t know how am I going to get rid of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apartment hunt: You sum up 6 months living on savings with stratospherical apartment prices and multiply it with no US credit score and you have a not-the-best situation. Thanks to the small savings I had and my family Iâ€™m staying in temporary places until I can fulfill all the <a href="http://www.citi-habitats.com/rent-nyc-guide/">crazy requirements</a> to get my â€œownâ€ place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New York streets doesnâ€™t look the cleaniest in the world. I know that itâ€™s a gigantic task but Iâ€™ve seen scenes on the street that remind me a lot to Phnom Penh and its wildlife. By the way, it hasnâ€™t reached any limit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On the good side:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The company: <a href="http://www.thrillist.com">Thrillist</a> is a great place to work. As soon as Iâ€™m getting into speed I enjoy it more and more. Every week there are fun/interesting activities organized by the company or the colleagues and I had a great first impression. Iâ€™m very thankful of the help Iâ€™m getting from my colleagues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public transportation: Even when rush hour seems to last forever, it works fast and I had just a short disruptions on the line Iâ€™ve been using (L). It works all day long, which seems like a miracle to me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The food: Iâ€™ve already been in nice places to eat and Iâ€™ve just started. I want to dive into the myriad of restaurants that you can find in here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cultural activities: I havenâ€™t tried them yet, but the program and possibilities are huge.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve missed St. Patrickâ€™s parade but Iâ€™ve realized that Iâ€™ve been in 5 different cities in the latest 5 years on that day. Should I book a good trip for next years or finally enjoy the parade and the party here?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m just looking forward the spring time, better weather, some tourist time and enjoy this city to its fullest.</p>
