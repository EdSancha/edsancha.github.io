I"­<p>I always remember my time at college with chills. Long hours studying, uninteresting labs and a feeling of lack of purpose. Of course, there were exceptions, both as courses and teachers but generally speaking that was and continues being my feeling.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve always said that Spanish Universities (or at least the one I studied: <a href="http://www.eite.ulpgc.es">Telecommunications in Las Palmas de GC, Canary Islands</a>) should be more practical. It wasnâ€™t until I left the country and I started working, first as an intern and lately as a full time full stack developer, that I found a purpose in technology.</p>

<p>This beautiful project, called <a href="http://www.ofbrooklyn.com/2014/09/6/building-pulse-bloom-biofeedback-burning-man-2014/">Pulse &amp; Bloom</a> that I just stumble upon is a great example of what you can make students do. It might not seem like a real world problem but a project like this has a lot of advantages. You teach them the technologies needed, delivery, teamwork and everything keeping them motivated. Itâ€™s also a perfect blend between art, hardware, software and education.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/samuelclay">Samuel Clay</a> describes the project in his <a href="http://www.ofbrooklyn.com/2014/09/6/building-pulse-bloom-biofeedback-burning-man-2014/">blog</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pulse &amp; Bloom is a <a href="http://www.burningman.com/installations/art_honor.html">2014 honorarium installation</a>. The core team of 6 people â€” <a href="https://twitter.com/sabarani">Saba Ghole</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shilo1221">Shilo Shiv Suleman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rd108">Rohan Dixit</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/heather.stewart.3388">Heather Stewart</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/liseman">Luke Iseman</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelclay">Samuel Clay</a> â€” built 20 interactive lotus flowers made out of steel and rowlux. Each lotus flower ranges from 8 to 18 feet tall, each of which lights up with your pulse. You and another person can put your hands on a couple of Hamsa hands at the base of the lotus flower and your respective heartbeats will light up the flower.</p>

<p>I recommend you to take a further look in the <a href="https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/studios/pulse-and-bloom#tab-info">NuVu Studio project webpage</a></p>

<p>Most of the people will say that you need resources, money, timeâ€¦ All those are excuses. Overcoming the problems will be part of the learning too. The closest thing we did was a small company for Economics which organized a small Employment and Technology forum. It incredibly ended being profitable (with most of the profits from the after party).</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been disconnected from the University world 10 years already and Iâ€™d like to know that the method has changed. That everything has evolved to a more practical method, as the one I experienced in <a href="http://www.telecom-bretagne.eu">ENST Bretagne</a> or what Iâ€™ve heard from some Tech Colleges here in US.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re teaching and reading this, please, make your students create things, theyâ€™ll thank you later from it. If youâ€™re already pushing your students to do cool stuff, thanks!</p>
