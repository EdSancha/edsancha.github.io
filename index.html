  <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
      Hi! I'm a Software Engineer from Canary Islands living in NYC since 2014. In the past, I lived in multiple places in Spain, France, Cambodia and California. I've been creating software experiences since 2009 and developing iOS apps in Objective-C and Swift since iOS 4 (2010), and professional experience in Scala, Microservices and Ruby on Rails backends.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm interested in technology, fitness, endurance training, parenting and I'll try <a href="/blog/">to write about all of this </a> and other things in the future.
