  <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
          
    <p>
            For the past few years I have been quite busy so I haven't worked on too many personal projects.

  <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
            I love sports, good food (preferably a good steak), beer with friends, biking, listening to music and traveling as much as I can. 
    </p>
    <p>
            Technically, I love iOS development and everything around it. You can find me watching WWDC videos in my free time or creating prototypes and I'd love to know how to build elegant, scalable and technology independent solutions.
