  <h2>I'm a Software Engineer</h2>

    <p>
            Hi! I'm a software developer from Canary Islands, Spain. In the latest years I've been living in Brest and Paris in France, jumping around Spain for couple of years and 2 years in the amazing Kingdom of Cambodia. After a year in San Francisco Bay area I moved to NYC's Brooklyn borough.
    </p>

  <h2>Personal Projects</h2>

    <p>
            For the past few years I have been quite busy so I haven't worked on too many personal projects.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/edsancha/edsancha.com/">edsancha.com</a></h3>
    <p>
            This is my personal web development playground (and blog) built in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>. As every good playground, it's in active mode, still playing with it.
    </p>

<!--           <h3><a href="http://cuddler.co/" target="_blank">Cuddler</a></h3>
    <p>
            Cuddler is a stealth fun project that will disrupt the dating market.
    </p> -->

  <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
            I love sports, good food (preferably a good steak), beer with friends, biking, listening to music and traveling as much as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
            Technically, I love iOS development and everything around it. You can find me watching WWDC videos in my free time or creating prototypes and I'd love to know how to build elegant, scalable and technology independent solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
            I also like to take photos from my mobile:
