<!--   <h2>About Me</h2>
 -->
  <p>
          Hi! I'm a spanish software creator from Canary Islands with roots in several places of Spain. In the latest years I've been living in Brest and Paris in France, jumping between Madrid and most of Canary Islands for couple of years and 2 years in the amazing Kingdom of Cambodia. Right now I live in San Francisco Bay area, CA.
  </p>
  <p>
          I work at <a href="http://www.eversnapapp.com">Eversnap</a> as Lead iOS Developer, a photo and video sharing startup in Sunnyvale.  
  </p>
  <p>
          Previously I worked as iOS Developer in <a href="http://www.goldengekko.com">Golden Gekko</a>, an award-winning international mobile agency recently acquired by <a href="http://http://dminc.com">DMI</a>.

  </p>
  <p>
          Before Golden Gekko, I was part of a J2EE development team building an ERP in an IKEA Company, Bitbox, and led a small mobile project on Windows CE and before that I worked in the Health Industry with Siemens Healthcare.  I've done backend and frontend development, programming, freelancing and consulting since high school.

  <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
          
          <p>
                  Last years I have been quite busy so personal projects section is a bit empty. 
          </p>

  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <p>
          I love sports, good food (preferably a good steak), beer with friends, biking, listening to music and traveling as much as I can. 
  </p>
  <p>
          Technically, I love iOS development and everything around it. You can find me watching WWDC videos in my free time or creating prototypes and I'd love to know how to build elegant, scalable and technology independent solutions.
