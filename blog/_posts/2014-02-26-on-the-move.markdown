I'm on the move, again. Next week I'll be starting a great job as iOS Developer in an amazing company, [Thrillist](http://www.thrillist.com), located in Soho, New York. It's hard to explain how excited I am about starting over again but I'll try. 

First of all, why New York? San Francisco Bay is a thriving environment with thousands of opportunities, it's probably the area with more exciting projects that you can find. In fact, I love it. 

Because I love it, that's why I have to leave it. I want to experiment another great city, probably the one who is closely behind SF in technological terms, to figure out what I want to do in long term. I've heard so good things about New York, that when the possibility appeared in front of me I jumped over it. 

Most of my friends support me blindly and I'm thankful for that. There're some that ask me about my fears, if I'm scared of a fresh start in the unknown and the fact is that I'm not. I'm nervous, excited and I want to do it. My fears are more related to what happens if I like it. How long will I be in NYC? One year, three, all my life? 

I have a place in my heart for the places I've lived in, [Las Palmas](http://instagram.com/p/Zk7NkyyiWy/), Paris, [Madrid](http://instagram.com/p/TxmXRySiel/), [Phnom Penh](http://instagram.com/p/oQYnr/), [San Francisco](http://instagram.com/p/Y6fv4wyiUo/). I know for sure that I'll be back to all of them and who knows, I might be back for more than holidays. I have great ideas for some of those places: I'd love to live _"on the road",_ living some months in different places but that's another story. My next step will be enjoying the renowned [Capital of the World](http://www.nyc.gov/html/lmec/html/about/nycapital.shtml) and tell the other places that:

_*It's a see you soon, not a goodbye.*_
