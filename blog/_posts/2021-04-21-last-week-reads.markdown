* Thoughtworks updated their [radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) and [Macro trends in the technology industry](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/macro-trends-technology-industry-april-2021). On a personal level, I like to see how Combine, SwiftUI and Kotlin Multi Platform are getting visibility. I think KMP is gonna be a key technology in the next months/years. It's important to note the importance they give to the rise of the platform teams.
* At my team we use a hybrid approach about this, but it still makes more sense to write the tasks you do, not the result [Write tasks not user stories](https://linear.app/method/write-tasks-not-user-stories).
* I’m one of those people that can’t sleep with a mosquito in the room until I find it so this story gave me goosebumps [The first swarm of genetically modified mosquitos is about to hit the US](https://www.popsci.com/story/science/gmo-mosquitoes-florida/).
* You can extrapolate this idea to any communication medium but the research behind it is really interesting: [High quality audio makes you sound smarter](https://tips.ariyh.com/p/good-sound-quality-smarter).
* Great article by HBR on [What does it mean to be a manager today](https://hbr.org/2021/04/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-manager-today) “Managers’ motivation to be empathic increases when they have a support system that makes it clear that the burden isn’t theirs alone and when organizations invest in roles designed to support them”.
* An introductory guide to understand DE&I [How Managers Can Advance Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion In The Workplace](https://www.mamieks.com/post/how-managers-can-advance-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-the-workplace).
