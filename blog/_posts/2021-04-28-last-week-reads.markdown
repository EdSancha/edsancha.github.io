*  Lastly, a strong emphasis on learning - including blameless post mortems, experimentation and short cycle feedback loops- can embed the sharing of knowledge and surfacing of relevant insights to aid in real time adaptation to changing conditions [Designing & Managing for Resilience](https://www.infoq.com/articles/series-enhancing-resilience-4/)
* Great article about how about efficient communication architecture and culture, starting by using principles like "Written over verbal" and "Async over Sync" and ending about using tools and frameworks like the [RACI Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix). Highly recommended. [How to Design a Communication Architecture](https://refactoring.fm/p/how-to-design-a-communication-architecture).
* On this article it shows how just a few seconds give hiring managers time to bias against people from a different socioeconomic status: [Yale study shows class bias in hiring based on few seconds of speech](https://news.yale.edu/2019/10/21/yale-study-shows-class-bias-hiring-based-few-seconds-speech).
* Old study I stumbled upon from 2019, demonstrating known gender bias, "By not fully recognizing leadership potential in female candidates, organizations are inhibiting the prospects of half of their talent. This inhibition ironically means organizations may be less likely to achieve their own full potential." [Overlooked Leadership Potential: The Preference for Leadership Potential in Job Candidates Who Are Men vs. Women](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00755/full).
* Some ideas that I've advocated in the past, mostly that years of experience ≠ skills, but I really liked the framework to measure team skills and room to improvement: [Myth: Experience Can't Be Taught](https://medium.com/skiller-whale/myth-experience-cant-be-taught-707ea9e71a15)
* A good article about what being a engineering manager means, specially right after coming from an IC position: [Being an engineering manager](https://medium.com/@marcus.cavalcanti/being-a-engineering-manager-9d2854867412).
* Old article about platform vs product teams and their relationships: [Stupid Baboons, Stubborn Elephants: A Product Engineer’s Guide to Working with Platform Engineers](https://rinaarts.medium.com/stupid-baboons-stubborn-elephants-c33412541bb1).
* Finally, a case of "ver la paja en ojo ajeno pero no la viga en el propio" (easy to see the speck in your brother's eye, but not so easy to see the plank in your own): [Breaking Camp](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy).
