* How leadership roles in engineering teams work, the different formats and how to solve some pitfalls [The Role of Tech Leads and Engineering Managers üëë](https://refactoring.fm/p/the-role-of-tech-leads-and-engineering).
* A really interesting article outlining common standup problems and how to focus on tasks rather than in people [The Daily Standup is a Waste of Time](https://buildthestage.com/the-daily-standup-is-a-waste-of-time/).
* A really good deck on implementing CI/CD. [It is time to fulfill the promise of CI/CD](https://speakerdeck.com/charity/cd)
* An interesting take on hiring, I believe hiring top talent still makes sense but my take is that it all comes down to hiring diverse talent. [Don‚Äôt hire top talent; hire for weaknesses](https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2021/04/10/dont-hire-top-talent-hire-for-weaknesses/).
* Another story of harassment and lack of support in a technology company, Google in this case. A must read from my point of view. [After Working at Google, I‚Äôll Never Let Myself Love a Job Again](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/opinion/google-job-harassment.html).
* Finally, reading some chapters of the Mythical Man-Month, and I loved this quote: *"All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this modern sorcery specially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers‚Äù* [The Mythical Man-Month](https://archive.org/details/MythicalManMonth/page/n27/mode/2up).
