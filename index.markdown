# Eduardo Diaz Sancha

Hi! I'm an Engineer Manager from Canary Islands living in NYC since 2014. In the past, I lived in multiple places in Spain, France, Cambodia and California. I've been creating software experiences since 2009, developing iOS apps in Objective-C and Swift since iOS 4 (2010), and I also have some professional experience in Scala, Microservices and Ruby on Rails backends.

I'm interested in technology, leadership, fitness & endurance training, parenting, traveling, electronic music and many other thigs! I'll try [to write about some of this subjects on this page blog](https://edsancha.com/blog).
