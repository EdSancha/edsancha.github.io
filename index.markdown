# Eduardo Diaz Sancha

Hi! I'm a Software Engineering Leader from the Canary Islands, living in Atlanta since 2022. In the past, I lived in multiple places, including Spain, France, Cambodia, Silicon Valley, and NYC. I've been creating software experiences since 2009, developing iOS apps in Objective-C and Swift since iOS 4 (2010), and have professional experience in Scala, Microservices, and Ruby on Rails backends.

I'm interested in technology, leadership, fitness & endurance training, parenting, traveling, electronic music, and many other things! I'll try [to write about some of these subjects on this page blog](https://edsancha.com/blog).
