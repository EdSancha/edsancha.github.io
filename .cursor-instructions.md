## Blog Post Formatting Instructions

This document outlines the standard format for creating and converting blog posts for this project.

### 1. File Naming Convention

Files should be named using the following format:
`YYYY-MM-DD-post-title-slug.markdown`

- `YYYY-MM-DD`: The publication date of the post.
- `post-title-slug`: A URL-friendly version of the post title (lowercase, words separated by hyphens).

### 2. YAML Front Matter

Each Markdown file must begin with a YAML front matter block. Below are the standard fields:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Title of The Post in Title Case"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: "Author Name"
timeToRead: "X minutes read" # Calculated based on ~200-250 words per minute
description: "A concise one-line summary of the article's content."
categories: category1 category2 category3 # Space-separated list of relevant lowercase tags/categories
image: "URL_to_featured_image.jpg" # Optional: For metadata or external use (e.g., social media previews, site listings). Images within the article content itself are handled in the Main Content section.
---
```

- **`layout`**: Typically `post`.
- **`title`**: The full title of the post, enclosed in double quotes, using title case.
- **`date`**: The publication date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **`author`**: The full name of the author, enclosed in double quotes.
- **`timeToRead`**: An estimated reading time (e.g., "3 minutes read"). Calculate this by dividing the word count by an average reading speed (200-250 words per minute).
- **`description`**: A brief, single-sentence description of the post content.
- **`categories`**: A space-separated string of relevant lowercase categories or tags.
- **`image`**: (Optional) A direct URL to a featured image. This field is primarily for metadata, social media previews, or article listings by the website theme. Images that are part of the actual article content should be embedded directly in the Markdown body (see section 4).

### 3. Initial Publication Note (for re-published content)

If the article was originally published elsewhere, add a note immediately after the YAML front matter. This note should be bold, italicized, and include a link to the original source.

Example:
```markdown
__(This article was published originally on [Name of Original Platform](URL_to_original_post) on the DDth Month, YYYY)__
```

### 4. Main Content and Inline Images

- Use standard Markdown for formatting the body of the post (headings, paragraphs, lists, bold, italics, links, etc.).
- **All images that are part of the original article's content and flow must be embedded directly into the Markdown body.**
- Convert HTML `<img>` tags (or similar constructs from the source) to Markdown image syntax: `![Alt text describing the image](URL_to_image.jpg)`.
- Place these inline images within the content flow where they appeared in the original article, ensuring they are relevant to the surrounding text.
- Ensure any other HTML content is properly converted to Markdown.

### 5. Call to Action / Concluding Remarks (Optional)

- If a specific call to action or concluding remarks section is present in the original post (like a contact link), it should be placed at the end of the Markdown content.
- A horizontal rule (`---`) can be used to separate this section from the main content if appropriate.

Example:
```markdown

### Conversion Process Summary:

1.  Convert HTML content to Markdown, preserving structure and meaning.
2.  Create a new file with the correct naming convention.
3.  Add the standard YAML front matter, filling in the details (calculate `timeToRead`, write `description`, identify `categories`). The YAML `image` field is optional and for metadata/external use.
4.  If applicable, add the initial publication note.
5.  Ensure the main content is correctly formatted in Markdown. **Crucially, embed all images from the original article directly into the Markdown body using `![alt text](URL)` syntax at their appropriate locations within the content.**
6.  If applicable, add any concluding call to action sections.
